# Big Dummy

This project is for folks who need to emulate an established blog with plenty of content while doing WordPress benchmarking and performance testing.

There are 2495 posts, 6197 comments, 231 tags, 26 categories, and 10 pages worth of WordPress dummy data, fully ready to import. That's 3 (simulated) years worth of content!

*Note:* There are ~1.6 GB of images (courtesy of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)) attached to these posts. It's a very good idea to import everything _but_ the media in order to avoid timeouts or errors with the WordPress Importer.

A [gzipped copy of `wp-content/uploads/`](https://goo.gl/9zikQQ) is available for download so you can copy the files over manually.
